About
=====

The platform picker extension provides a Sphinx directive that marks certain sections of the documentation as platform-specific. Readers can then select the section for the platform they're interested in. Choosing a different platform affects all of the sections on the same page.

The stylesheet provided by the extension works best with the `Read The Docs <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/>`_ theme.
